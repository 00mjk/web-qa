<h1>How You Can Help</h1>

<p>
	You can help the QA effort in several ways:
	<ul type="disc">
	<li><span class="lihack"> If you have some spare time, why not join the PHP/QA team?  Follow the <a href="members.php">members</a> link to find out how.</span></li>
	<li><span class="lihack"> Submit a bug report.  If you find what you think is a problem, drop by <a href="http://bugs.php.net/">http://bugs.php.net/</a> and submit a report.  Just make sure to read the <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bugs-dos-and-donts.php">Dos and Dont's</a> of bug submission before posting a bug.</span></li>
	<li><span class="lihack"> Give a PHP/QA Team member space on a server that you administrate.  To do this, please send mail to the PHP/QA email list (<a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net?Subject=Guest%20Account%20for%20PHP/QA%20Team%20Member">php-qa@lists.php.net</a>) with the subject 'Guest Account for PHP/QA Team Member'. In the body of the message, please list the specifications on the machine (hardware, operating system, installed software, etc...).</span></li>
	</ul>
